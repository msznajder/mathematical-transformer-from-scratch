    "Goal: Build LLM model from scratch - not pre-trained - and train it to learn basic integer based math with addition, subtraction and multiplication. \n",
    "I want to check how well LLM - like this one just trained from scratch - can learn math. This is not a symbolic system. It uses tokens. Can tokens be used for math calculations? In further steps: \n",
    "1) Maybe embedding representing tokens are in fact kind of symbolic representation? This is worth checking - how these numbers and operations embedding behave and what are their relations.\n",
    "2) If vanilla LLMs with token embeddings will prove not very good at math can we somehow expand them to somehow get/arrive at/generate symbolic math operation within such model? I mean here creating LLM models with internal represenations with a flavour of Wolfram Alpha/Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mean here the fact that LLMs are - and will be more and more - used for mathy problems. For example recently Microsoft started offering \"Copilot for Finance\" based on ChatGPT. I imaging that it is based on token and wonder how reliable the math side of it can be. And maybe: how could such models can be modified - both in terms of their architectures and the way they represent stuff like math - to be better at math. For now elementary like integer addition, subtraction and multiplication operations.\n",
